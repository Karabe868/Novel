    <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: The Eyes In The Fog</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
The fog came early that morning—thicker than usual, clinging to the thatched roofs of Elder Hollow like wet wool. It crept in through shutters and doorframes, curling along the cobbled streets with the hunger of something alive.

Elara knew better than to ignore it.

She wrapped her cloak tighter and stepped outside. The pendant her grandmother had left her pulsed faintly beneath her collar, warm to the touch. It always did when the shadows stirred.

A few villagers emerged with her, their faces pale and drawn, eyes darting toward the forest’s edge. No one said a word, but all of them knew. The whispers had returned last night. Faint, almost indistinct, but unmistakable—like breath on the back of the neck when you're alone in the dark.

“Elara,” came a voice—sharp, nervous. It was Tomas, the blacksmith’s son. “They found something in the field.”

She followed him without question.

The fog grew denser the closer they came to the fields beyond the river. Shapes moved within it—quick, darting movements too low and too fast to be human. Elara kept her hand on the hilt of her dagger.

They arrived at the far fence where a group had gathered, whispering and wide-eyed. In the center of the circle, half-buried in the damp earth, was something she didn’t expect.

A mirror.

Old. Cracked. Framed in twisted black iron.

And it was whispering.

Not aloud—but inside her.

“She sees. She remembers.”

Elara backed away.

But her reflection did not.

It stayed.

Smiling.
