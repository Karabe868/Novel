    <h1 class="title">The Whispering Shadows</h1>
    <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: The Eyes In The Fogs</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
The fog came early that morning—thicker than usual, clinging to the thatched roofs of Elder Hollow like wet wool. It crept in through shutters and doorframes, curling along the cobbled streets with the hunger of something alive.

Elara knew better than to ignore it.

She wrapped her cloak tighter and stepped outside. The pendant her grandmother had left her pulsed faintly beneath her collar, warm to the touch. It always did when the shadows stirred.

A few villagers emerged with her, their faces pale and drawn, eyes darting toward the forest’s edge. No one said a word, but all of them knew. The whispers had returned last night. Faint, almost indistinct, but unmistakable—like breath on the back of the neck when you're alone in the dark.

“Elara,” came a voice—sharp, nervous. It was Tomas, the blacksmith’s son. “They found something in the field.”

She followed him without question.

The fog grew denser the closer they came to the fields beyond the river. Shapes moved within it—quick, darting movements too low and too fast to be human. Elara kept her hand on the hilt of her dagger.

They arrived at the far fence where a group had gathered, whispering and wide-eyed. In the center of the circle, half-buried in the damp earth, was something she didn’t expect.

A mirror.

Old. Cracked. Framed in twisted black iron.

And it was whispering.

Not aloud—but inside her.

“She sees. She remembers.”

Elara backed away.

But her reflection did not.

It stayed.

Smiling.

  <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 2:Reflections That Lies</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
  The villagers had long since scattered, but Elara remained at the edge of the field, her eyes fixed on the mirror.

Her reflection was still smiling.

She wasn’t.

Slowly, she crouched down, dagger drawn, and brushed away more of the soil surrounding the mirror. As her fingers touched the cold frame, a shock ran through her—like a jolt of lightning in her veins. She yanked her hand back.

Behind her, the fog began to twist.

Shapes slithered through it—tall, thin, barely distinguishable from the mist itself. One moved like it had too many joints. Another whispered her name in a voice that sounded like breaking glass.

She stood, heart pounding, and turned away from the mirror—but not before it changed.

Her reflection blinked.

Then it reached toward her from inside the glass.

“Elara!” a voice called out.

It was Corin, breathless, running toward her with a hunter’s bow slung over one shoulder. He paused when he saw the mirror. His face went pale.

“That wasn’t here yesterday,” he said.

“I know. It… showed up after the whispers returned. And it knows me.”

Corin stepped forward, but Elara grabbed his wrist. “Don’t touch it.”

“Too late,” he said grimly, nodding toward her hand.

She looked down.

Where her fingers had grazed the frame, black veins had begun to creep under her skin.

She could feel it now—something ancient, something buried deep within her blood stirring for the first time in years.

“Elara,” the mirror said aloud this time, its voice her own.

And then, like glass exhaling, a thin crack split down its center.

From within, something knocked.

Once.

Twice.

Three times.
