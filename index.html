    <h1 class="title">The Whispering Shadows</h1>
    <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 1: The Eyes In The Fogs</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
The fog came early that morning—thicker than usual, clinging to the thatched roofs of Elder Hollow like wet wool. It crept in through shutters and doorframes, curling along the cobbled streets with the hunger of something alive.

Elara knew better than to ignore it.

She wrapped her cloak tighter and stepped outside. The pendant her grandmother had left her pulsed faintly beneath her collar, warm to the touch. It always did when the shadows stirred.

A few villagers emerged with her, their faces pale and drawn, eyes darting toward the forest’s edge. No one said a word, but all of them knew. The whispers had returned last night. Faint, almost indistinct, but unmistakable—like breath on the back of the neck when you're alone in the dark.

“Elara,” came a voice—sharp, nervous. It was Tomas, the blacksmith’s son. “They found something in the field.”

She followed him without question.

The fog grew denser the closer they came to the fields beyond the river. Shapes moved within it—quick, darting movements too low and too fast to be human. Elara kept her hand on the hilt of her dagger.

They arrived at the far fence where a group had gathered, whispering and wide-eyed. In the center of the circle, half-buried in the damp earth, was something she didn’t expect.

A mirror.

Old. Cracked. Framed in twisted black iron.

And it was whispering.

Not aloud—but inside her.

“She sees. She remembers.”

Elara backed away.

But her reflection did not.

It stayed.

Smiling.

  <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 2:Reflections That Lies</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
  The villagers had long since scattered, but Elara remained at the edge of the field, her eyes fixed on the mirror.

Her reflection was still smiling.

She wasn’t.

Slowly, she crouched down, dagger drawn, and brushed away more of the soil surrounding the mirror. As her fingers touched the cold frame, a shock ran through her—like a jolt of lightning in her veins. She yanked her hand back.

Behind her, the fog began to twist.

Shapes slithered through it—tall, thin, barely distinguishable from the mist itself. One moved like it had too many joints. Another whispered her name in a voice that sounded like breaking glass.

She stood, heart pounding, and turned away from the mirror—but not before it changed.

Her reflection blinked.

Then it reached toward her from inside the glass.

“Elara!” a voice called out.

It was Corin, breathless, running toward her with a hunter’s bow slung over one shoulder. He paused when he saw the mirror. His face went pale.

“That wasn’t here yesterday,” he said.

“I know. It… showed up after the whispers returned. And it knows me.”

Corin stepped forward, but Elara grabbed his wrist. “Don’t touch it.”

“Too late,” he said grimly, nodding toward her hand.

She looked down.

Where her fingers had grazed the frame, black veins had begun to creep under her skin.

She could feel it now—something ancient, something buried deep within her blood stirring for the first time in years.

“Elara,” the mirror said aloud this time, its voice her own.

And then, like glass exhaling, a thin crack split down its center.

From within, something knocked.

Once.

Twice.

Three times.

  <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 3:The Thing Beneath The Glass</h2>
<p class="paragraph">
The third knock echoed like a drumbeat inside Elara’s chest.

Then silence.

Corin stepped back, raising his bow, though they both knew an arrow wouldn’t help against what was behind that mirror. The fog around them seemed to hold its breath—no wind, no sound, just the waiting hush of something watching.

Elara crouched beside the mirror again. The black veins on her hand pulsed with a dull ache, winding further up her forearm. “It’s trying to come through,” she whispered.

Corin’s eyes narrowed. “Can it?”

The mirror answered for them. A hiss, faint and sharp, like a blade unsheathing, filled the air. The crack widened—spiderwebbing across the glass until it looked like ice ready to shatter.

From within the cracks, a black mist began to leak—slow at first, then faster, coiling like smoke in water. Elara gritted her teeth as a voice rose from within the glass, not hers this time, but something deeper, older.

“The seal is breaking. The veil is thinning. And the Hollow will remember.”

The words struck something inside her. Memory—or maybe dream. A flash of a girl in a red cloak standing in firelight. A ring of figures chanting beneath a blood moon. And a name. Her name—but not her voice.

“Elara, we need to go. Now,” Corin urged.

She nodded, and together they turned to flee, the mirror behind them hissing and warping the air like heat over stone. As they ran, the fog thickened, chasing them now, swirling with fragments of whispers in tongues not spoken for centuries.

They barely made it back across the stone bridge before the first scream came.

It wasn’t human.

The villagers saw them coming and rushed to meet them—until they saw Elara’s hand.

The black veins had reached her shoulder.

A sharp gasp rang out.

“She’s been marked,” someone whispered.

“She’s one of them now,” said another.

And then, from the center of the crowd, the village elder stepped forward, eyes hollow and afraid.

“It’s beginning again.”

    <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 4:The Elder's Warning</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">
      
The villagers fell silent as Elder Maeve stepped into the square. Her back was bent with age, but her voice carried the weight of prophecy.

“Elara is not cursed,” Maeve said, eyes locked on the black veins climbing the girl’s arm. “She is chosen.”

Gasps rippled through the crowd.

Elara stood stunned, her breath catching. “Chosen for what?”

“To seal what we once failed to destroy,” Maeve said, her gaze distant, haunted. “The mirror was one of many—fragments of the Gate. We shattered it a hundred years ago and scattered the pieces. We thought it was over.”

Elara felt the weight of fate settle like stone on her shoulders. “Why me?”

“Because your blood remembers. Your grandmother bore the mark before you. She held the seal for decades. When she died, it passed to you—silent, sleeping. Until now.”

Corin stepped beside her. “So what do we do?”

Maeve’s answer was slow, deliberate. “You must find the others—before they find you.”

    <h2 class="chapter-title">Chapter 5:Ash and Salt</h2>
    <p class="paragraph">     
      That night, Elara lay awake, staring at the veins on her arm. They no longer hurt. Instead, they hummed—like a song she’d known in childhood but forgotten how to sing.

The pendant at her neck pulsed in time with that song.

Maeve gave her a map, crude but marked with symbols: six shards of the Gate, scattered across the lands. The mirror was one. The next lay beyond the salt marshes, in the abandoned village of Dreyholt.

At dawn, she and Corin set out.

The marshes were treacherous. The fog clung thicker here, and things moved beneath the water that should not have. Shadows stretched too far. Eyes blinked from the reeds.

At Dreyholt, they found silence. Buildings sunken and rotting. But in the chapel's crypt, half-buried in mud, was a silver bell—tarnished, but intact.

Elara reached for it, and the moment her fingers touched the metal, the air twisted. A figure appeared—tall, shrouded in robes of ash. It had no face, only a mouth, and it spoke without sound.

“Two have heard. Four remain. And the Gate stirs.”

The bell let out a single chime, and a gust of black wind knocked them both to their knees.

                                                              They returned to Elder Hollow changed.

The bell now hung at Elara’s side, heavy as guilt. It whispered names in her sleep. Some she knew. Some she hadn’t yet met.

And one she feared.

Vaelryn.

She first heard it on the wind, then etched into the side of the mirror, then in Maeve’s journal—scribbled dozens of times in frantic ink.

Vaelryn: The Voice in the Shadows. The one who first opened the Gate.

And now he was waking.

As the second shard merged with the mark on her skin, the black veins turned silver, glowing faintly. She could feel the power beneath her bones—vast, ancient, and not entirely hers.

Maeve called a meeting.

“The Gate is not just a doorway,” the elder said. “It is a hunger. Each shard reawakens what was buried. And only the marked can stop it.”

Elara rose, eyes burning with a light that hadn’t been there before. “Then show me where the third piece is.”

Maeve hesitated. “It lies in the Whispering Vale. Where your grandmother made her final stand.”

“And where Vaelryn first walked.”

Elara nodded.

“Then that’s where I’m going.”
